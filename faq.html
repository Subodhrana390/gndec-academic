    <h2>What are Accreditations?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Agreements among the bodies responsible for accrediting specific degree programs in each of the signatory
            nations. Accreditations recognize that a program has a program that has established quality standards.</li>
        <li>In most cases, accreditation means that graduates of accredited programs are in any of their country making
            it easier for the graduate to be employed.</li>

    <h2>Describe Bloom's Taxonomy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bloom's taxonomy can be defined as a broad perception of learning. This taxonomy is useful in communicating
            performance of many students. Bloom’s Taxonomy is one of the most widely used taxonomies and is a
            hierarchical model that classifies educational objectives into three domains: cognitive, affective, and
            psychomotor. Cognitive domain is the most popular and the one most widely used and this domain has six
            levels and can be categorized as learning to be higher levels of thinking. These levels are remembering,
            understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. The Bloom's Taxonomy can be used as a useful
            tool to increase understanding and can be used by teachers to create more relevant and valuable educational
            objectives for the students, and are valuable for educators to create assessment tools, and are very helpful
            for educators to facilitate student learning. Bloom's taxonomy is a useful tool to communicate learning and
            can be used to facilitate learning.</li>
        <li>Bloom’s taxonomy was developed by Benjamin Bloom, an American educational psychologist, in order to promote
            higher levels of thinking in education such as analyzing and evaluating, for the purpose of testing and
            assessment of students. The original six levels of the taxonomy were: Knowledge, Comprehension, Application,
            Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation. In 1994, the taxonomy was revised by a group of educators and the names
            of some of the levels were slightly changed to better reflect the action of the verbs. The revised levels
            are: Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, and Creating. The new taxonomy has been
            called the Revised Bloom's Taxonomy.</li>
        <li>There is an order to these levels, and it is easier to apply a higher level if you already possess the
            knowledge and the skills of the lower levels. Bloom’s Taxonomy has been helpful in planning curricula and in
            creating assessment tools, and it is often used by teachers to create more engaging and challenging learning
            activities for students. The idea of the taxonomy is that learning can be seen as a hierarchy of skills, and
            that the levels of thinking are cumulative.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Describe Revised Bloom's Taxonomy & Anderson and Krathwohl’s Taxonomy?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Anderson and Krathwohl (2001), Bloom’s Taxonomy, and the Revised Bloom’s Taxonomy, given slightly different
            names, to the levels, all three hold by Anderson and Krathwohl, Bloom’s taxonomy was revised and the names
            were slightly changed to better reflect the action of the verbs. The revised levels are: Remembering,
            Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, and Creating. The new taxonomy has been called the Revised
            Bloom’s Taxonomy.</li>

            that the levels of thinking are cumulative.</li>
        <li>This is a helpful framework for thinking about learning. The taxonomy has 6 levels. The levels are:</li>
        <li>Remembering – the ability to recall facts or basic information. Examples: memorization, definition,
            identification, and recalling information such as identifying and understanding the meaning of specific
            information, facts, or ideas.</li>
        <li>Understanding - the ability to grasp the meaning of information, facts, or ideas. Examples: interpreting,
            translating, explaining, and summarizing, but may not really understand the information. </li>
        <li>Applying - the ability to use information to solve problems or in different situations. Examples: applying
            information to new situations, solving problems, and making predictions.</li>
        <li>Analyzing - the ability to break information down into its component parts. Examples: analyzing the process
            of examining information in order to make reasoned decisions regarding cause and effect.</li>
        <li>Evaluating - the ability to make judgments about information. Examples: evaluating arguments, making
            judgments, and recommending solutions.</li>
        <li>Creating - the ability to produce new information. Examples: designing, inventing, and creating something
            new or original on opinions, procedures, etc. At this level, students are considered in creating these new
            or original things. </li>
